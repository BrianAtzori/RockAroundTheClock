# RockAroundTheClock
A simple Clock made with Start2Impact Academy Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY

For the second module of the academy, "Javascript Basic", the academy suggest to follow the linked youtube tutorial as an exercise.

For the future i would like to improve the clock trasnforming it in a "Rock Clock", maybe with some background video of concerts and/or some background music (rock), as a tribute to the famous song.
